- hi GDG guys
- Cnglish again!
- i'm Zoom.Quiet, come from China, as GDG ZhuHai Organizer
- my Barcamp topic is:
    - base '[L10N](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization)' make GDG chapters 
- and pay attention, my slides is base s5,its pure html page
    - so had released into internat
    - thit is the URL 
    - http://zoomquiet.org/res/s5/130512-gdgsummit/

## Zoom.Quiet

- yep,i know the Zoom.Quiet is error name
- but again,its my realy NikName
- and base the error name , i hold the global unique id !
- so the logo is show about what my error name realy means

## disclaimer
<!--more-->

- all my public speech, hold one page abt. Disclaimer
- that all

## brief

- today,i just want to sharing two points
- what is problem in china gdg
- and how 2 fix it?

## population

- we know China population is very large!
- in fact more than 1.3 billion!
- the number is come from 2011
- now? of course more than it!

## Means..

- its means every year! 
    - there will appended 6 million students
    - for china colleges
- and also means every year!
    - thers will granduation 0.6 million students
    - work as coder

## GDG in china

- and we know, China had 14 cities had GDG
- and in total there is 0.01 million member for China GDGs
- but think about every year!
    - thers will granduation 0.6 million students
    - work as coder
    - China GDG member is sooo litter

## Why?!

- why soo litter member?!
- i persnal guess is:
    - GDG in china is not FUN enough!

## Difficulty in China

- for chinese developer
- the bigest problem maybe is GFW
    - we call its 功夫网
    - what means? thers has link
    - its wikipedia, you can read it later
- and just know because GFW
    - youtube is invalidation
        - means GDL is non-existent for chinese
    - site.google also invalidation
        - means us GDG organizer summit is non-existent for chinese
    - plus.google also invalidation
        - means G+ is non-existent for chinese
    - developer.google also invalidation
        - means GDA (Academy) is non-existent for chinese

## difficulty PLUS

- almost contents in YouTube is English
- almost contents in sites also English
- almost contents in developer also English
- BUT!
    - the mostly chinese developer only can Cnglish
    - and in the same time, most people is shy
    - shy to ask

### so always fall in bad loop

- not understand
- shy
- not ask
- more not understand
- just got zeor fun
- had to leaved GDG 


## how fix it?

- i am believe in Henry Ford said:
    - * Coming together is a beginning; 
    - * keeping together is progress; 
    - * working together is success.

## GDG in Global

- again, we know there is 109 contries had GDG
- 390 cities had GDG chapter
- in fact non-English chapter is not litter

## so what kinds of tasks

- can make Chapters working together?!

## L10N

- means Localizition



## such as ZhuHai GDG

- as GDG we have:
    - mailing list
    - G+ pages
    - G+ Commuinity
    - weibo ~ kinds of Twitter in china
    - wechat ~ knids og Whatsapp in china
    - bbs ~ the chinese habit communication way
    - and usage Trello as Kanban system
        - coordination community intra. matters

## GDG core

- so in my minds
- GDG 's core is eventes
    - because we must base events
    - make people get together to learnning/coding/sharing

## events just beginning

- after start
- how to make people hold on learnning/coding/sharing
- my way is: H2H
    - means heart 2 heart
    - must continual communication with ture man!


## L10N

- so for GDG ,it almost everywhere need L10N


## as standard GDG

- makeup buy member
- and member is always working as
    - as organizer
    - as learnner
    - as volunteer
    
## L10N for organizer

- can make Pari Eventes
- such like Pair Programming
- bettewn GDGs 
    - for make great event
    - sharing good ideas/flows/games
    - together make series Brand events
    - such as 
        - GDG GuangZou invention "College OpenDay"
        - so others GDG can copy the event
            + name
            + contents
            + advert storys
            + etc.


## L10N for learnner

- can together to translate GDL videos
- because Chinese learned English is booking english
    - almost developer just can write and read
    - but can not speeking
    - means chinese Shy in realy-world, BUT NOT Internet ;-)
- so base GDL caption translating
- in fact, the learnner is sharing out them learnning process
- of course, if always some guys, whoes level like self
    - to togehter fix all kind of troubles
    - to togehter grasp new technic
    - the process is must be FUN


## L10N for developer

- base sdk from developers.google.com
- there is soooo many cool things wait us make it
- through code, non-English Chapter can fun together


## L10N for volunteer

- spread each other events
- spread each other design
- spread each other gifts
- spread each other storys
    - the story is always the most touch part of community
    - yeah!

## Zoomation

- so you heard out
- the Localization is "Zoomation" Localization
- the key is
    - NEW FRINDS
    - GDG guys always is sweet guys
    - so say we are!
    - we must became new friend
- and make some good guys becaming new frinds
    - is always includ fun
    - this kinds of fun
    - can create good loop in GDG
        - new friends
        - new fun
        - so more friends
        - get more fun
        - of course member can more and more ;-)

## that all

my core points is:

- * English not fun in Chinese
- * "L10N" is always need in GDG
- * Pair someting make fun
